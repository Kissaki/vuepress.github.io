# headers

A header is a headline in the document. The lower the number, the
more important the header. They have semantic meaning. Your audience, 
search engines, and screen readers are meant assign the most importance
to an H1, less to an H2, and so on. HTML only recognizes levels 1 to 6.
It's good writing practice to assign importance only to levels 1-3.

## Markdown

The original formatting used on VuePress documents. It is an 
extended version of [markup](#markup) devised on the
blog [daring fireball](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).
Its name is a humorous take on the term [markup](#markup).

Special characters
starting lines or surrounding phrases are converted to formatting or links.

For example, a line consisting `# Welcome` gets converted to 
just the world `Welcome` but it's formatted as an HTML header, so it
will appear different from body text. In this document, it is
normally synonomous with [markup](#markup).
