### By Tom Campbell
Thank you for reading the VuePress Book. Like VuePress, this book is free
and [open source](https://github.com/tomcam/vuepress.github.io).

The [VuePress documentation](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/guide/) is
excellent but geared toward people with experience using static site generators. This book is for people who haven't had that privilege. It assumes
little: you're expected to be familiar with using a command line but
it doesn't expect you to know one in particular, so there are both
Windows and Mac versions because you might be a Mac user who's forced
to use a Windows system, or the other way around.

If you're still not sure why you'd want to use VuePress or even what
it's for, see the [introduction](/introduction.md). 
Otherwise, this book is pretty much written in the order you'd
create and deploy a site, so start with the [tutorial](/tutorial/tutorial1.md).

This book is in no way affiliated with nor endorsed by any of the official VuePress team. All mistakes are the responsbility of me, the author, and I'm
a chimp compared to [Evan You](https://github.com/yyx990803), the
creator of [VuePress](https://github.com/vuejs/vuepress).
