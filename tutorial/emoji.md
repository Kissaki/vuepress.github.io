# Emojis in VuePress markdown

VuePress includes emojis as part of its Markdown extensions. You include them in your text by surrounding 
an emoji code with colon characters. For example, you'd use `:smile:` for :smile:,
or `:thumbsup:` for :thumbsup:.

Here is a table with some common  emojis. For the full list of supported codes see the
