# Adding markup to create a site footer to your home page YAML

The default home page has a footer option available through YAML. 
Here's an example:

You can add a footer to your site with the--wait for it--`footer` directive in your YAML.

```yaml
footer: 18005 NE 68th St, Springfield â€¢ (555) 621-4572
```
