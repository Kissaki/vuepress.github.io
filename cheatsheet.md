# Cheatsheet: Checklist for creating a VuePress site

## Set up the project directory

* [Create a directory](/creating-the-directories-for-your-vuepress-site.md) for your project.
For example, if your project is at `~/mybook`:

```bash
# Generate full directory path, including the
# necessary hidden directory .vuepress
$ mkdir -p ~/mybook/.vuepress
# These directories hold images and CSS. You 
# don't need to use this convention.
$ mkdir -p ~/mybook/assets/img
$ mkdir -p ~/mybook/assets/css
```

* Change to the project root directory

```bash
# Replace this with whatever directory
# you used for your VuePress installation.
$ cd  ~/mybook/
```
## Create the home page

* Obtain an image file for the main home page image (called the hero image). In this example
it's called logo.png but the name and size don't matter. 

It's best to get one with
a transparent or white background if you're using the default VuePress theme
with no changes.

* Create the file `README.md` and give it the following contents.

```txt
---
# Specify this is the home page 
# (and therefore uses the Home.vue template)
home: true
# Put a big centered H1 in the middle of the page
heroText: Main title of your site

# Image for the center of the home page
heroImage: /assets/img/logo.png

# Explain what the site is all about
tagline: Catchy description of site

# Text for the big green button:
actionText: See our Menu â†’

# Place big green button should link to. 
actionLink: ./menu.md
---
## Secondary title-less important thatn heroText

And regular text goes here.
```
