# Cheatsheet: Checklist for creating a VuePress 

Here's the bare minimumm you need to get a VuePress site up and running from scratch using the default theme.

## Set up the project directory, MacOS version

* [Create a directory](/creating-the-directories-for-your-vuepress-site.md) for your project.
For example, if your project is at `~/mybook`:

```bash
# Generate full directory path, including the
# necessary hidden directory .vuepress
$ mkdir -p ~/mybook/.vuepress
# These directories hold images and CSS. You 
# don't need to use this convention.
$ mkdir -p ~/mybook/assets/img
$ mkdir -p ~/mybook/assets/css
```

## Set up the project directory, Windows version

* [Create a directory](/creating-the-directories-for-your-vuepress-site.md) for your project.
For example, if your project is at `%HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH%\mybook`:

```batch
:: Generate full directory path, including the
:: necessary directory .vuepress
> md %HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH%\mybook\.vuepress
:: These directories hold images and CSS. You 
:: don't need to use this convention.
> md %HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH%\mybook\assets\img
> md %HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH%\mybook\assets\css
```

## Create the home page

The home page of a site using the default VuePress theme is kind of a splash screen, more for 
showing off a site than for reference. So give it a nice bold image.

* Change to the project root directory (MacOS):

```bash
# Replace this with whatever directory
# you used for your VuePress installation.
$ cd  ~/mybook
```

* Change to the project root directory (Windows):

```batch
:: Replace this with whatever directory
:: you used for your VuePress installation.
> cd  %HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH%\mybook
```

* Obtain an image file for the main home page image (called the hero image). In this example
it's called logo.png but the name and size don't matter. 

It's best to get one with
a transparent or white background if you're using the default VuePress theme
with no changes.

* Create the file `README.md` and give it the following contents.

The parts in between `---` lines are called [YAML](/default2.md). They do not display directly but
they contain site settings. The site's content appears after the second `---`, so in this case it's
a level 2 header that says `Secondary title-less important thatn heroText`.

```txt
---
# Specify this is the home page 
# (and therefore uses the Home.vue template)
home: true
# Put a big centered H1 in the middle of the page
heroText: Main title of your site

# Image for the center of the home page
heroImage: /assets/img/logo.png

# Explain what the site is all about
tagline: Catchy description of site

# Text for the big green button:
actionText: See our Menu â†’

# Place big green button should link to. 
actionLink: ./menu.md
---
## Secondary title-less important thtn heroText

And regular text goes here.
```

## Add a title, mobile menu, and search

The site's global title, search capability for header levels 1-3, and mobile
"hamburger" menu are added with `title` and `description` attributes of `config.js`.

* Create the file `/.vuepress/config.js` with contents along these lines:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  title: "Springfield Dim Sum",
  description: "Springfield's best Chinese food!"
}
```

## Adding other directories

You can add more directories to organize your site. Each directory must contain 
file named `README.md`.
