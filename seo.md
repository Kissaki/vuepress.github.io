## Good organization makes great SEO

Both people and search engines love well-organized sites. In general:

* Keep to one topic per page
* The first header of the page should be an H1 (A single `#` starts the header) and should contain the keyphrase
users are most likely to search for
* There should be only one H1
* Subordinate topics should be hierarchically organized, so H2 subtitles would be second-most important and H3s would be
third most important

All of these principles are general and your mileage may vary. If a hugely influential Instgrammer, 
former US president, or FIFA star happens to mention your site online, it will rocket to the
top of search at least temporarily no matter how badly it's search engine optimized.

## Open source helps

If you're willing to make the source pages of your book publicly viewable on GitHub, you'll get a huge SEO booost.
